# NoteTaker-Express

 An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and can save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

 For users that need a little help organizing thoughts, keeping track of tasks you need to complete or just to keep track of a lot of information. Life moves fast and sometimes it's easy for us to forget or simply be unable to recall some of those important "something's". Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have those written "something's" available when and where needed.
